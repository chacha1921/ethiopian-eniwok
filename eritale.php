                                        <p>Erta Ale is 613 metres (2,011 ft) high, with one or sometimes two active lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side of the volcano.[1] It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the world.[4]<br><br>Erta Ale means "smoking mountain" in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as "the gateway to Hell". In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques,[5] in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures.<br><br>Erta Ale is centered over the East African Rift system, which is a triple junction setting whose movements are resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin or rift. The volcano comprises mainly mafic material which has been brought up to the surface caused by unroofing of the mantle due to this rift formation.[citation needed]<br><br>There was a major eruption on 25 September 2005 which killed 250 head of livestock and forced thousands of nearby residents to flee.[6] There was further lava flow in August 2007, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and leaving two missing.[7] An eruption on 4 November 2008 was reported by scientists at Addis Ababa University.[8] Another eruption was reported in January 2017.[9<br><br></p>
